You are given a portfolio of $1,000 and five companies to play with. We'd like you to create a simple interface with the following functionalities:

	- Represent the portfolio value
	- For each company, display name, symbol, price and quantity owned. For each companies, two buttons: buy and sell (if owned). Clicking 'Buy' buys one share, 'Sell' sells one share.
	- Upon clicking a button, update the value of the portfolio, update the number of shares owned, and enable or disable the "sell" or "buy" buttons accordingly.
	- Every 1 second, the program should randomly change the price for each company from a range of (+/- $0.10)
